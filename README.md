# GnarpyAI
I'm planning on making this have the same features as both *character.ai* and *JanitorAI* while having a Wii Aestetic. A "sequel" to [PugsbyAI](https://Pugsby.github.io/PugsbyAI)

## Versions
*Version 1* ~ Initial Upload. Currently has a WII aestetic. Took 2 days to make.

## Features
- AI (obv)
- Customizable AI chatbot
- Custom model and reverse proxy (based on zukiijourney)

If you ever want to branch this, try to give me credit (Pugsby)
